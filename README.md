# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning Flat Clustering
K-Means clusternig example with Python and Scikit-learn 
# Flat clustering
Clustering algorithms group a set of documents into subsets or clusters . The algorithms' goal is to create clusters that are coherent internally, but clearly different from each other. In other words, documents within a cluster should be as similar as possible; and documents in one cluster should be as dissimilar as possible from documents in other clusters.
# Hierarchical 
Hierarchical clustering is where the machine is allowed to decide how many clusters to create based on its own algorithms.
